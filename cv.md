### Frontend developer

More than half of a year ago I quitted my job to learn Frontend development. 
There is an exciting journey and I am thankful to RSSchool for walking me through enourmous amount of knowledge.
The studying is not a piece of cake for me, although this is not a rocket science. I'm here to catch up with the gaps I haven't managed to learn during the previous course.  
What can I say about me? I worked as a technologist of medicines at pharmaceutical company. I liked it because my work required high attention to the details, sequense, work with different hardware and writing detailed instructions for workers. Isn't it similar to JavaScript coding? I think so :smirk:  
As for my hobbies I'm addicted by English, travelling and floristry. I also adore bicycle trips and photography, especially film photography.
